## This program follows exactly as the example to create
## a special object that stores a matrix and caches its inverse. 
## (The program and even the comments are also just some naive replacements of the example, OMG...)
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to
##	1	set the value of the matrix
##	2	get the value of the matrix
##	3	set the value of the inverse matrix
##	4	get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse matrix has already been calculated. If so, it gets the 
## inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and 
## sets the value of the inverse matrix in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
}
